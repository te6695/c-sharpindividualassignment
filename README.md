  Emergency Response Simulation

    Overview
This project simulates an emergency response system, where different units (Police, Firefighters, Ambulances) handle various incidents based on their type. Users interact by entering incident details, and the simulation determines which unit responds, tracking points based on successful handling of incidents.

      Features
- Abstract base class for Emergency Units.
- Specialized classes for Police, Firefighters, and Ambulances.
- Custom `Incident` class to represent incident type and location.
- Dynamic scoring system based on incident handling.
- Interactive console-based simulation.
